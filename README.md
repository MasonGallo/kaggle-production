# What is kaggle-production?

Kaggle solutions that are easy to implement and productionize.

Instead of buying tons of GPU compute power on AWS, I emphasize simpler solutions that are easier to implement.

# What's the point?

How well can "simple" solutions score? A "simple" solution should be easier to productionize with low runtime and low memory requirements.
